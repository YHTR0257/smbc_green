# Report on Data Science Project

## Overview
This report summarizes the findings and methodologies used in the data science project. The project aims to analyze and model data to derive insights and predictions.

## Data Sources
- **Raw Data**: The raw datasets were collected from various sources and stored in the `data/raw` directory.
- **Processed Data**: The data was cleaned and transformed, with the processed datasets stored in the `data/processed` directory.

## Methodology
1. **Data Exploration**: Initial exploration was conducted using the Jupyter notebooks located in the `notebooks` directory. Key insights were documented in `01_data_exploration.ipynb`.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Relevant features were engineered to improve model performance, as detailed in `02_feature_engineering.ipynb`.
3. **Model Prototyping**: Various models were prototyped and evaluated in `03_model_prototyping.ipynb`.

## Results
- The best-performing model was selected based on evaluation metrics and is saved in the `models` directory.
- Visualizations related to the analysis and results are stored in the `reports/visualizations` directory.

## Conclusion
The project successfully achieved its objectives, providing valuable insights and a robust model for predictions. Future work may involve further tuning of the model and exploring additional data sources.
